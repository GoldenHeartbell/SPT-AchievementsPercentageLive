## Achievements Perecentage Live
This mod displays the percentage of players who have completed a achievement in the game per achievement. The mod will automatically update the percentage once the server starts and then every 6 hours upon starting the server.

## Configuration
As of version 1.1.0, the mods configuration file allows you to change the update interval of the mod. The default update interval is 6 hours. To change the update interval, open the `/config/config.json` file in the mod's folder and change the `updateIntervalInHours` value to the desired interval in hours.

If you update from version 1.0.0 make sure that the `nextUpdate` value is set to 0, to ensure that the new update interval is applied.
